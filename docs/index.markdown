## Theat Intelligence Sharing

This project seeks to provide a space to share threat intelligence that the California Department of Transportation has accrued.

This intelligence comes from a variety of sources:

- Simple static analysis of malware binaries
- Dynamic sandbox analysis of malware binaries
- Analysis of phishing campaigns
- Compilation of external threat intelligence briefings

This information will include URLs, domains, and IP addresses identified by the Departments security team through the above mentioned analysis

The list of URLs is located [here](urls.txt)

The list of Domains is located [here](domains.txt)

The list of IPv4 addresses is located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltrans-ssd/caltrans-ssd.github.io/main/docs/ipv4.txt)
